📝 Project: APOD Content Classification 🌌
📖 Description

This project builds a content classification model for the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) dataset.
The goal is to predict whether a record is:

🖼️ image

🎥 no-image (merging video and other classes)

The workflow uses:

✍️ TF-IDF for text vectorization (title + description)

⚖️ RandomOverSampler for class balancing

🌲 RandomForest as the classifier

🛠️ Key Libraries

pandas

scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, classification_report)

imblearn (RandomOverSampler)

matplotlib (for plots, e.g., Precision-Recall Curve)

collections.Counter (for class distribution visualization)

🔄 Workflow

✍️ Text Preprocessing

Concatenate title + description → full_text.

Vectorize using TF-IDF.

⚖️ Class Balancing

Apply oversampling only on the training set using RandomOverSampler.

Avoid contaminating the test set.

🌲 Model Training

Classifier: RandomForestClassifier with class_weight='balanced'.

Train on the balanced data.

📊 Evaluation

Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy.

Confusion matrix.

Use predict_proba to adjust the threshold for no-image.

Precision-Recall curve to select the optimal threshold.

🎯 Expected Results

The model correctly predicts most 🖼️ image examples.

Adjusting the threshold improves recall for the minority class 🎥 no-image.

Final output includes precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and the Precision-Recall curve.

🚀 How to Run

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook.ipynb step by step.

Adjust the threshold for 🎥 no-image based on the Precision-Recall curve.

⚠️ Notes

Due to extreme class imbalance, it is recommended to merge minority classes or collect more data.

Metrics like Accuracy can be misleading; use macro F1 and balanced accuracy for fair evaluation.
